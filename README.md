The Data Science Job Salaries dataset constains information about different jobs in the data industry from 2020 to 2022, including the company location, employment type, experience level and remote ratio. I used SQL to clean the data and perform my analysis and Excel for the visualization.
There are 607 records and 12 columns in this dataset.
